1. Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.



Vulnerability: The code in insecure.ts allows privilege escalation by relying on user-provided 
IDs and roles without proper verification.

Secure Version: The secure version uses session-based authentication and authorization, ensuring 
only authenticated users with the 'admin' role can update roles.



2. What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?



Multi-Factor Authentication
Role-Based Access Control
Audit Logging
Input Validation and Sanitization
Rate Limiting
Secure Coding Practices
