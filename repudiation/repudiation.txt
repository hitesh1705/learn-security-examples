- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.

Vulnerability: insecure.ts lacks proper logging, allowing users to deny their actions.

Secure Version: secure.ts implements detailed logging of user actions with timestamps 
                and user information, providing a reliable record to verify activities.



- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Digital Signatures: Ensure log integrity and authenticity.
Tamper-Evident Logs: Detect unauthorized changes to logs.
Access Controls: Restrict log access to authorized personnel.
Encryption: Protect log files from unauthorized access.
Regular Audits: Detect and respond to suspicious activities.
Immutable Logs: Prevent modifications after logs are written.
